Hi Alexa!
I want to ask you for a favor in this readme document!
If you have the time, could you please provide me with feedback on my writing style, arguments, and any other areas that could be improved?
I would really appreciate it.

Also, here is the link to all the preprocessed EEG data. They were large files, therefore I could not upload them on GitHub.
